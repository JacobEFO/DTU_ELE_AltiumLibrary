# Contributing
Any DTU ELE student can feel free to contribute to the communal DTU ELE Library. However we have a set of guidelines for the components and the footprints.

In order to have a coherent structure please follow the upcomming rules and requirements for schematic symbols, footprints and integrated libraries.

If these guidelines are not followed, the pull request will be declined.

## Rules and Requirements
Update this with some text.

### Schematic Symbols

### Footprints

[Vendor Codes](https://techdocs.altium.com/display/ADOH/Vendor+Codes)

### Integrated

### Naming Convention


## Licenses
Under no circumstances must any licensed content excluding academic OR commercial use be used in the building of the components. This in general applies to especially 3d models found on the internet.
